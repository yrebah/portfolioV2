    "roadmapParagraph2":"A few months after the start of my training (BTS SIO-SLAM), the choice of a profession imposed itself on me. Indeed, this training totaled a large number of areas related to computer science; in January 2019, I therefore decided to devote most of my learning time to website development.",
    "roadmapParagraph3":"In order to stand out, from 2020 I put my knowledge of web development into practice by carrying out a large number of professional and personal web projects. This is the year during which I made the most progress, especially with regard to responsive design and the JavaScript language.",
    "roadmapParagraph4":"I had the opportunity to carry out major professional projects, such as the development of a real-time cratography system as well as a business framework (JavaScript). At the same time, on my personal time, I continued my learning via many online tutorials.",
    "roadmapParagraph5":"Now that I've mastered the fundamentals of web development, it's time for me to find my place in the job market. I therefore devote my time to the realization of this portfolio by integrating a maximum of knowledge and hope to be able to integrate a company in the coming weeks.",
    "roadmapParagraph6":"I hope that one term this year I will have the opportunity to tackle more ambitious projects and that I will be able to participate actively in the development of more complex sites. Whatever happens, I will continue to nurture my interest in Web development by pursuing my personal projects.",
